<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>
This is a preliminary implementation guide created by Healthcare Services Platform Consortium as a means of publishing the top 2000 LOINC lab FHIR profiles.  This publication is intended to facilitate discussion about the content and design for these models.  Currently only the quantitative labs have been generated and published here.  The coded &#40ordinal, nominal, etc.&#41 will be published in the near future with the remaining types to follow.
